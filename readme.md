# **Database configuration**

This project works with mongoDB server. The connection string can be specified in the .env file. Initially, there is no such a file. So first you should create a .env file in the project directory as a copy of sample.env file. Then change .env accordingly - initialize DB and Telegram's API\_KEY variables.

1. Download MongoDB
2. Create a new folder to store the data
3. run mongod --port 27017 --dbpath PathToTheNewFolder
4. create a .env file in the project directory as a copy of sample.env file

# **Starting the bot**

User can make the bot working by passing the command "/start" to it or just pressing "Начать" in telegram mobile or desktop clients.

# **Database structure**
writeData() method populates the database using the bulkWrite() method and an object called MQuiz, which represents the data model for quiz questions.

The bulkWrite() method allows for multiple write operations to be executed in a single database transaction to ensure data integrity. Each object in the array defines a write operation, which can be adding a new record, updating an existing record, or deleting a record.

Each object defines a filter, which is used to select the record in the database to be modified, and an update that contains new values for the fields that need to be saved in the database.

Additionally, each object contains quizId, questionText, tags for searching questions, and answer choices with their text and an isCorrect flag indicating whether this choice is the correct answer.

possible structure:

```js script
var resQuizz = await MQuiz.bulkWrite(updateOne:{
    filter:{ quizId: "SQL_L7_R1Q2", tags:"samples" },
    upsert:true,
    update: {
    quizId: "SQL_L7_R1Q2", 
    questionText: `Which query is equivalent to SELECT * from A cross join B?`,
    tags:["samples"],
    options:[
            {
                ptionId: 1,
                isCorrect:true,
                text:"SELECT * from A join B on 0 = 0"
            },
            {
                optionId: 2,
                isCorrect:false,
                text:"SELECT * from A join B on 1 = 0"
            },
            {
                optionId: 3,
                isCorrect:false,
                text:"SELECT * from A, B where 0 = 1"
            }]
        }
    })
```
